Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. freeCodeCamp just launched our new JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Certification. You can now take the final exam and earn this verified cert, then add it to your LinkedIn, CV, or personal website. This is version 10 of the core freeCodeCamp curriculum. The community collectively spent thousands of hours developing all this to serve as your shortest path to acquiring programming fundamentals. (300 hour interactive curriculum – announcement article and FAQ): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-new-javascript-certification-is-now-live/

2. freeCodeCamp also published a project-oriented course on building your own AI agents using the n8n framework. You'll learn about vector databases, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, multi-workflow builds, and more. You can code along at home, and by the end of the course you'll have a variety of agentic projects you can show off to your friends.

3. On this week's podcast I interview Kunal Kushwaha. He's a software engineer and prolific computer science teacher on YouTube. After years of preparation, he failed India's Engineering Entrance Exam not once but twice. But he persevered. He built his own learning path by contributing code to open source projects. In his short career as a developer, he's worked at small startups as well as at a big UK cloud provider as their field CTO. He shares tons of tips for learning new skills, being productive while working remotely, and his thoughts on the Indian higher education system.
