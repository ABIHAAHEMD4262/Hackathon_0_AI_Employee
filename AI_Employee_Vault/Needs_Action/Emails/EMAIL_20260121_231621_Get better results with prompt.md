Small changes to your prompts can dramatically improve Claude's responses. 








The art of prompting Claude 
Whether you're just getting started or already using the Claude API, the 
quality of Claude's responses depends heavily on how you structure your prompts.

Prompt engineering is one of the most important skills for getting value from 
the Claude API. Here are three techniques to transform your results:


 * Be clear, direct, and detailed: Claude performs best when you provide 
specific instructions.

 * Provide context: Explain why your task matters to help Claude deliver more 
targeted responses.

 * Use examples: Include 2-3 samples in your prompt to improve accuracy and 
consistency.
