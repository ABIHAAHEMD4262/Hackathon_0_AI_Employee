Prompt caching and smart model selection can dramatically lower your costs. 








Build efficiently with Claude 
You're building with Claude—now let's optimize your implementation. Here are 
four ways to reduce costs without sacrificing quality.

Reduce costs with prompt caching 

If you're sending the same context repeatedly (like documentation, system 
prompts, or conversation history), prompt caching can optimize your API usage. 
Implement prompt caching 
<https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching> 






Process large volumes of requests efficiently 

Batch processing allows asynchronous processing of large volumes of requests 
with a 50% discount on both input and output tokens.

Choose the right model for each task 

Match your use case to the most cost-effective option: 




Claude Haiku 4.5 
Fastest model with near-frontier intelligence for high-volume processing 


Claude Sonnet 4.5 
Smartest model for complex agents and coding tasks 


Claude Opus 4.1 
Exceptional model for advanced reasoning and creative tasks 


Unsure which model to use? Start with Sonnet 4.5 during development, then 
evaluate if you can downgrade to Haiku 4.5 for production or upgrade to Opus 
4.1 only for your most complex requests. 






Monitor your usage in real-time 

Track spending with Claude Console reporting. View token consumption by 
endpoint, identify expensive requests, and export detailed reports to manage 
your API costs effectively.
