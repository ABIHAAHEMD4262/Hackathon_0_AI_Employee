Transparency is important to us, so we want to inform you about a recent security incident at Mixpanel, a data analytics provider that OpenAI used for web analytics on the frontend interface for our API product (platform.openai.com). The incident occurred within Mixpanel’s systems and involved limited analytics data related to your API account.

This was not a breach of OpenAI’s systems. No chat, API requests, API usage data, passwords, credentials, API keys, payment details, or government IDs were compromised or exposed.

*What happened*
On November 9, 2025, Mixpanel became aware of an attacker that gained unauthorized access to part of their systems and exported a dataset containing limited customer identifiable information and analytics information. Mixpanel notified OpenAI that they were investigating, and on November 25, 2025, they shared the affected dataset with us.

*What this means for you*
User profile information associated with use of platform.openai.com ( http://platform.openai.com ) may have been included in data exported from Mixpanel. The information that may have been affected was limited to:

* Name that was provided to us on the API account
* Email address associated with the API account
* Approximate coarse location based on API user browser (city, state, country)
* Operating system and browser used to access the API account
* Referring websites
* Organization or User IDs associated with the API account

*Our response*
As part of our security investigation, we removed Mixpanel from our production services, reviewed the affected datasets, and are working closely with Mixpanel and other partners to fully understand the incident and its scope. We are in the process of notifying impacted organizations, admins, and users directly. While we have found no evidence of any effect on systems or data outside Mixpanel’s environment, we continue to monitor closely for any signs of misuse.

Trust, secu
